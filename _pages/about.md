Hi there -- thanks for stopping by! 

My name is Sara. I recently graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from Ferdowsi Uni of Mashhad, Iran.

The list of projects I have contributed to are [here](https://SaraAsadi.github.io/projects/).

BTW, I always look for new opportunities to involve in interesting projects and I am flexible for relocation! 
...If you wish to collaborate feel free to drop me a message via email or Linkedin.
